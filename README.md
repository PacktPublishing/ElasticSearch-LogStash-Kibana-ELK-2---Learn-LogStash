## About the Video Course
In the recent years â€“ the term BigData has been gaining popularity. And there has been a paradigm shift in the volume of information and the ways in which it can be extracted from this data. ELK is one of the few new-age frameworks which is capable of handling Big Data demands and scale. Over the years the ELK stack has become quite popular. And for a good reason. It is a very robust, mature and feature rich framework. ELK is used by large enterprises, government organizations and startups alike. The ELK stack has a very rich and active community behind it. They develop, share and support tons of source code, components, plugins and knowledge about these tools freely and openly. Imagine a large organization, which has information coming in from varied sources, at varied frequencies, and in various formats. It will be a herculean task to sort and sift through this data and normalize it to use for any comprehensive analysis. We will need a pretty versatile and flexible tool to deal with all these permutations of data streams. In this course, we will focus on one such enterprise data collection and collation tool-The LogStash which is one of the core components of the ELK stack. We will look at the overview and explore the technology that goes behind this tool. Knowledge and experience about ELK and LogStash could be very valuable for your career.
